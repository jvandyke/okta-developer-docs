If you are building a server-side (or web) application that is capable of securely storing secrets, then the authorization code flow is the recommended method for controlling access to it.

See our [OAuth 2.0 overview](/docs/concepts/oauth-openid/#authorization-code-flow) for more information on the Authorization Code flow, including why to use it.
